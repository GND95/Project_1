Motivation & Summary Slide

Define the core message or hypothesis of your project. KELLY
- Certain audio features will help contribute to the likely success of a track. We looked at audio features as defined by Spotify, as well as genre and number of collaborators on a track.
- MOTIVATION - curiosity as to what audio features drive the success of music right now, discuss how in light of the pandemic people have turned to music/streaming now more than ever


Questions & Data

Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it - data on audio features of currently popular music, found Spotify data on Kaggle
IRENE
Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

QUESTIONS WE ASKED:
- What attributes are most likely to indicate a song's success in our current media climate?
- What is the most popular genre in each decade of release dates?
- What is the most popular genre in the past 100 years?
- What is the effect that the number of collaborators has on the success of a song?
- Are solo songs or collaborative songs more likely to succeed?


Data Cleanup & Exploration

Describe the exploration and cleanup process
- What are the limitations of our dataset? - only a snapshot of what's popular now regardless of release date, subjective measurements, some metrics are based on numerical values while it's not clear for some metrics how they were determined, whether certain measurements are reliable or not (SARAH)
- How have the parameters that define the dataset changed over time? (SARAH)
- How/why are the parameters of the dataset defined the way they are? (look to documentation) (SARAH)

Discussion

Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?
- song attributes have generally become more extreme over time



Post Mortem

Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them - difficulties with artits and genre data, highlight Garrett's code for parsing genre, synergistic work between Irene's data cleaning and Garrett's function GARRETT

Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?
- What attributes are most likely to indicate a song's success in our current media climate? (KELLY) - discuss scope/limitations of our project
